# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository

This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects we create.

In this project, we will analyze the data using SQL and Excel. We will explore the data, clean and transform it to derive useful insights from it.

Dataset
Our dataset consists of sales data for a company. It has the following columns:

Order ID
Product
Quantity
Price per unit
Date
Customer
Country
The dataset is in a CSV format and can be downloaded from here.

Setup
We will be using SQL and Excel for our data analysis. Here's what you need to set up:

SQL
Install an SQL database (we recommend MySQL or SQLite)
Import the dataset into the database
Install an SQL client (we recommend MySQL Workbench or DBeaver)
Excel
Install Microsoft Excel (version 2013 or later)
Open the dataset in Excel
Analysis
Data Cleaning
We will begin by cleaning the data. Here are the steps we will take:

Remove any duplicates
Remove any missing values
Remove any unnecessary columns
Exploratory Data Analysis
Once we have cleaned the data, we will explore it to gain a better understanding of it. Here are the things we will do:

Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.)
Visualize the data using charts and graphs
Identify any trends or patterns in the data
Transformations
We will then transform the data to derive useful insights from it. Here are the transformations we will perform:

Group the data by customer, country, and product
Calculate total sales for each customer, country, and product
Calculate the average price per unit for each product
Results
Finally, we will present our results. Here are the things we will do:

Create a report summarizing our findings
Create visualizations (charts and graphs) to support our findings
Draw conclusions and make recommendations based on our analysis
Conclusion
In this project, we have analyzed sales data using SQL and Excel. We have cleaned the data, explored it, transformed it, and presented our findings. We hope that our analysis has provided valuable insights for the company.
